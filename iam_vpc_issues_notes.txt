1. Check the Lambda function's network configuration:
   - Navigate to the Lambda function 'postgres_dataload' in the AWS Console
   - Go to the 'Configuration' tab and select 'VPC'
   - Verify that the function is associated with the correct VPC, subnets, and security group

2. Review the security group settings:
   - Go to the EC2 dashboard in the AWS Console
   - Navigate to 'Security Groups' and find the security group 'sg-0b1904a991eaccc33'
   - Ensure that the outbound rules allow the necessary traffic for the Lambda function to communicate with external services

3. Check the Lambda function's IAM role permissions:
   - In the Lambda function configuration, go to the 'Configuration' tab and select 'Permissions'
   - Click on the role name 'lambda_execution_role' to view its details in the IAM console
   - Review the attached policies and ensure they provide the necessary permissions for the function to access required AWS services

4. Verify the Lambda function's environment variables:
   - In the Lambda function configuration, go to the 'Configuration' tab and select 'Environment variables'
   - Check that the 'DATABASE_URL' variable is correctly set and the database is accessible from within the VPC

5. Analyze the CloudWatch logs:
   - In the Lambda function's 'Monitor' tab, click on 'View CloudWatch logs'
   - Look for any specific error messages or stack traces that might provide more details about the 'error sending request'

6. If you don't have permissions to do the following changes, contact your AWS Administrator:
   - Add a more specific policy to the Lambda execution role to ensure it has the necessary network-related permissions:
     ```json
     {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
         {
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Action": [
             "ec2:CreateNetworkInterface",
             "ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces",
             "ec2:DeleteNetworkInterface"
           ],
           "Resource": "*"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

7. Increase the Lambda function timeout:
   - Go to the Lambda function's 'Configuration' tab and select 'General configuration'
   - Increase the timeout value to allow more time for the function to complete its execution

8. Test the Lambda function:
   - Use the 'Test' tab in the Lambda console to create a test event and run the function
   - Monitor the execution and check for any new error messages or logs
